/**
 * Problem Statement
Given an unsorted array of integers, nums, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity.

Example 1:
Input:
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output:
4
Explanation:
The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4], which has a length of 4.
